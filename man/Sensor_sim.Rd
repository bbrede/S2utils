\title{Simulate sensor}
\usage{
Sensor_sim(simulator, target, eps)
}
\arguments{
\item{simulator}{Simulator/emulator}

\item{target}{Simulated sensor}

\item{eps}{The simulator and the target need to share at least one wavelength for which both their responses are hight than eps}
}
\value{
weights to apply to the bands of src to simulate target; as matrix
}
\description{
Assume the simulating sensors has more bands than target sensor.
